# CLNDR2.js

[Work in progress]

[![Test Status][github-action-image]][github-action-url]

CLNDR2 is a slim and straightforward front-end calendar widget offering smooth design
customizations.<br />
It is the unofficial successor to [CLNDR](https://github.com/kylestetz/CLNDR).

Instead of a providing a jQuery plugin, CLNDR2 provides an ES module and will be rewritten in
Typescript. Eventually, the jQuery dependency will be removed, the deprecated moment dependency
replaced and the soft dependency on Underscore replaced with EJS templating.<br />
CLNDR2 also comes with Storybook demos and 100% automated test coverage.

Demos: https://CLNDR2.snater.com

Documentation specific to CLNDR2 will be added at a later point. For now, please refer to the
[CLNDR](https://github.com/kylestetz/CLNDR) readme for additional information and configuration
options.
